update observer location when manually input changed.
terrain profile needs to maintain aspect ratio when window size is changed. currently it streaches.

zoom into radial LOS on the terrain map when radial los is generated.

min max tower height needs to account for trees.

change "use towers" to "manual towers"

Future
allow drag and drop of observer and remore end in path profile to update gps location.
radial lines are not working correclty review what i am trying to achieve. look at topography. is it first time los is lost.  what about section after this. it should be a dashed line showing areas with los.
also add this to profile. eg arcs showing the sections along the route that have los from the observer.
